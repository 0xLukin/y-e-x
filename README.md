This project is an entry for the Beijing ETH Hackathon Competition. We hope to develop it into an open-source project and welcome everyone to contribute code together.

## Intro

We are designing a new paradigm of holding DeFi in the form of funds. We believe that individual investors face many difficulties participating in DeFi, and our new tools will change this situation.

Our project is initiated by the [Honeypot Finance](https://twitter.com/honeypotfinance) team.
